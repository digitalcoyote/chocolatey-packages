<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://chocolatey.org/docs/create-packages -->
<!-- It is especially important to read the above link to understand additional requirements when publishing packages to the community feed aka dot org (https://chocolatey.org/packages). -->

<!-- Test your packages in a test environment: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->

<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

    <!-- This section is about this package, although id and version have ties back to the software -->
    <!-- id is lowercase and if you want a good separator for words, use '-', not '.'. Dots are only acceptable as suffixes for certain types of packages, e.g. .install, .portable, .extension, .template -->
    <!-- If the software is cross-platform, attempt to use the same id as the debian/rpm package(s) if possible. -->

    <!-- version should MATCH as closely as possible with the underlying software -->
    <!-- Is the version a prerelease of a version? https://docs.nuget.org/create/versioning#creating-prerelease-packages -->
    <!-- Note that unstable versions like 0.0.1 can be considered a released version, but it's possible that one can release a 0.0.1-beta before you release a 0.0.1 version. If the version number is final, that is considered a released version and not a prerelease. -->

    <summary>Oh my Posh is a custom prompt engine for any shell that has the ability to adjust the prompt string with a function or variable.</summary>
    <description>## Introduction
What started as the offspring of oh-my-posh2 for PowerShell resulted in a cross platform, highly customizable and extensible prompt theme engine. After 4 years of working on oh-my-posh, a modern and more efficient tool was needed to suit my personal needs.

## Features
* Shell independent
* Git status indications
* Failed command indication
* Admin indication
* Current session indications
* Language info
* Shell info
* Configurable
* Fast

## Package Specific Flags
Versions after 8.5.0 default to Installing for All Users. Flag `CURRENTUSER` can be used to install only for the current user. See [Issue 34 on the package repo](https://github.com/digitalcoyote/chocolatey-packages/issues/34) for more info on why this change was made.

## Virus Scan Results
There are some false positives associated with Oh-My-Posh and they are being tracked in [Issue 767](https://github.com/JanDeDobbeleer/oh-my-posh/issues/767)
 and is a somewhat common issue with programs written in Go. </description>
