    <description># Buildozer

Buildozer is a command line tool to rewrite multiple
[Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel) BUILD files using
standard commands.

## Usage

```shell
buildozer [OPTIONS] ['command args' | -f FILE ] label-list
```

Here, `label-list` is a space-separated list of Bazel labels, for example
`//path/to/pkg1:rule1 //path/to/pkg2:rule2`.

When `-f FILE` is used, buildozer reads commands from `FILE` (`-` for stdin).
Format: lines of `|`-separated sets of commands and labels (`command args|label|label...`).
When the label is a single '*', then the command will be applied to all
elements of label-list from the command line.

You should specify at least one command and one target. Buildozer will execute
all commands on all targets. Commands are executed in order, files are processed
in parallel.

### Targets

Targets look like Bazel labels, but there can be some differences in presence of
macros.

  * Use the label notation to refer to a rule: `//buildtools/buildozer:edit`
  * Use the `__pkg__` suffix to refer to the package declaration:
   `//buildtools/buildozer:__pkg__`
  * Use an asterisk to refer to all rules in a file: `//pkg:*`
  * Use `...` to refer to all descendant BUILD files in a directory: `//pkg/...:*`
  * Use percent to refer to all rules of a certain kind: `//pkg:%java_library`
  * Use percent-and-number to refer to a rule that begins at a certain line:
   `//pkg:%123`.
  * Use `-` for the package name if you want to process standard input stream
   instead of a file: `-:all_tests`.</description>
